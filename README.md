# Template Extensions

The goal of this library is to easily create HTML templates with dynamic parts
which is covered by the API's based on the
[Template Instantiation](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md)
and [DOM Parts](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/DOM-Parts.md)
proposals.

## TODO

In addition it adds new API's to enhance existing elements with these dynamic parts.

## Credit

The template instance and DOM parts code is based on the great work of 
[Dmitry Iv.](https://github.com/dy) and [Keith Cirkel](https://github.com/keithamus).
